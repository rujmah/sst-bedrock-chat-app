# SST and Bedrock Chat app

This is a basic chat app using [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) as the GPT provider (is that thing?)

The [SST Framework](https://sst.dev) is a set of high level CDK components and a CLI that makes creating and maintaining apps on AWS a breeze 🌬️

I'm using NextJS as the frontend with Tailwind CSS. App based on the TailwindCSS template by [Rob Stinson](https://codepen.io/robstinson/pen/oNLaLMN) 🙏
